abstract = {Indonesia is the most important producer country of snapper and grouper species worldwide, with a notable increase in landings over the past decades. The Java Sea is one of the most frequently fished areas for these species in Indonesia, but in 2016 a decrease in landings was observed. This study applied two approaches (Length-based Indicators and Length-Structured Growth-Type-Group Model) to assess the status of snapper and grouper fisheries in the Java Sea, using length-composition data from the commercial fishery and covering multiple gears with different selectivity. The work focused on the dominant species in the catches: Malabar blood snapper (Lutjanus malabaricus), Areolate grouper (Epinephelus areolatus), Crimson snapper (Lutjanus erythropterus), and Goldbanded jobfish (Pristipomoides multidens). Considerable differences were observed, related to the type of gear used. Catch data obtained from the longline fishery presented good stock status indicators for all species studied. The spawning potential ratio (SPR) estimates calculated for Malabar blood snapper and crimson snapper indicated that these species are currently fished in the Java Sea at unsustainable levels (below 30 {\%} SPR) by the dropline and mixed-gear fleets, while areolate grouper and goldbanded jobfish are not overfished (above 30 {\%} SPR). For both methods, bias in Linf and, secondarily, bias in M/K have a stronger influence on the indicators values, in particular for the proportion of individuals above the length of optimal yield + 10 {\%} (Pmega) estimates and SPR, than bias in Lmat values. This study highlighted other areas where improvements are critical to ensure the sustainability of the snapper and grouper fisheries in the Java Sea.},

@article{Hordyk2014,
abstract = {? 2014 ? International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2014. All rights reserved.Evaluating the status of data-poor fish stocks is often limited by incomplete knowledge of the basic life history parameters: the natural mortality rate (M), the von Bertalanffy growth parameters (L? and k), and the length at maturity (Lm). A common approach to estimate these individual parameters has been to use the Beverton-Holt life history invariants, the ratios M/k and Lm/L?, especially for estimating M. In this study, we assumed no knowledge of the individual parameters, and explored how the information on life history strategy contained in these ratios can be applied to assessing data-poor stocks. We developed analytical models to develop a relationship between M/k and the von Bertalanffy growth curve, and demonstrate the link between the life history ratios and yield- and spawning-per-recruit. We further developed the previously recognized relationship between M/k and yield- and spawning-per-recruit by using information on Lm/L?, knife-edge selectivity (Lc/L?), and the ratio of fishing to natural mortality (F/M), to demonstrate the link between an exploited stock's expected length composition, and its spawning potential ratio (SPR), an internationally recognized measurement of stock status. Variation in length-at-age and logistic selectivity patterns were incorporated in the model to demonstrate how SPR can be calculated from the observed size composition of the catch; an advance which has potential as a cost-effective method for assessing data-poor stocks. A companion paper investigates the effects of deviations in the main assumptions of the model on the application of the analytical models developed in this study as a cost-effective method for stock assessment [Hordyk, A.

@article{Ault2019,
abstract = {This study extended a “data-limited” length-based stock assessment approach to a risk analysis context. The estimation-simulation method used length frequencies as the principal data in lieu of catch and effort. Key developments were to: (i) incorporate probabilistic mortality and growth dynamics into a numerical cohort model; (ii) employ a precautionary approach for setting sustainability reference points for fishing mortality (FREF) and stock reproductive biomass (BREF); (iii) define sustainability risks in terms of probability distributions; and, (iv) evaluate exploitation status in terms of expected length frequencies, the main “observable” population metric. This refined length-based approach was applied to six principal exploited reef fish species in the Florida Keys region, consisting of three groupers (black grouper, red grouper, and coney), two snappers (mutton snapper and yellowtail snapper), and one wrasse (hogfish). The estimated sustainability risks for coney were low ({\textless}35{\%}) in terms of benchmarks for fishing mortality rate and stock reproductive biomass. The other five species had estimated sustainability risks of greater than 95{\%} for both benchmarks. The data-limited risk analysis methodology allowed for a fairly comprehensive probabilistic evaluation of sustainability status from species and community perspectives, and also a frame of reference for exploring management options balancing sustainability risks and fishery production.},

@article{Carruthers2014,
abstract = {The majority of global fish stocks lack adequate data to evaluate stock status using conventional stock assessment methods. This poses a challenge for the sustainable management of these stocks. Recent requirements to set scientifically based catch limits in several countries, and growing consumer demand for sustainably managed fish have spurred an emerging field of methods for estimating overfishing thresholds and setting catch limits for stocks with limited data. Using a management strategy evaluation framework we quantified the performance of a number of data-limited methods. For most life-histories, we found that methods that made use of only historical catches often performed worse than maintaining current fishing levels. Only those methods that dynamically accounted for changes in abundance and/or depletion performed well at low stock sizes. Stock assessments that make use of historical catch and effort data did not necessarily out-perform simpler data-limited methods that made use of fewer data. There is a high value of additional information regarding stock depletion, historical fishing effort and current abundance when only catch data are available. We discuss the implications of our results for other data-limited methods and identify future research priorities. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},
